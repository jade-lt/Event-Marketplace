# Event-Marketplace

A place where an event planning, hire or services business can keep track of inventory levels, current pricing of their product/service, along with info on their own suppliers/cost for each product. 

In future I plan to add the option for each product/service to have a public facing listing with availability calendars that are book-able in real time by clients, along  and a messaging platform between bsuinesses and clients.

The app inclues log in/sign up functionality with encrypted passwords:

Once logged in the user is taken to the dashboard which shows their current listings and a fom to either add a new listing or update/delete an existing one:
